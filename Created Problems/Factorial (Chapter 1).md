# Problem: Factorial
## tl;dl
Implement a program that calculates a value factorial, per the below.
```
./factorial
n: 5
120
```
## Background
As some of you may know, the factorial of a number is the product of all integers below it. For example,
5 factorial (or 5!) is equal to 5\*4\*3\*2\*1. Implement a program that takes a number n and outputs n!.

## Specification
In `factorial.c` in `~chapter1/factorial`, write a program that prompts a user for a number n and then
reports (via `printf`) the factorial of the number. If the number given is not an integer or the number is negative,
your program should ask for n again.
